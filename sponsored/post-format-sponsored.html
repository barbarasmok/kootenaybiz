									<h3>Realtor® Sandy Smith explains how to buy a house long distance with confidence</h3>
									<p> For those of us who want to say thank you to our moms, it’s not always easy to
										put those big feelings in words. Which is where Dribbble comes in.</p>
									<p>These eight shots crystallize the hard work moms put into keeping their kids
										alive, happy, and healthy. They might give you the inspiration you need for
										filling out that card—or stand alone for your mom’s interpretation.</p>

									<p>Moms are the ones who bandage our boo-boos when we’re little and continue to take
										care of us as we get older—often sacrificing their own needs so they can help
										with ours. Cruising on a bike to help heal our injuries is the most mom thing
										one can do.</p>

									<p>Moms are like…buttons? Moms are like glue. Moms are like pizza crusts. Moms are
										the ones who make sure things happen—from birth to school lunch.</p>
									<p>They’re the ones we rely on for playdates and emotional support, homework help
										and babysitting. Moms are the ultimate dependable support. Like, hopefully, the
										button on your jeans.</p>
									<p>My hero when I was a kid was my mom. Same for everyone I knew. Moms are
										untouchable. They’re elegant, smart, beautiful, kind…everything we want to be.
										At 29 years old, my favorite compliment is being told that I look like my mom.
										Seeing myself in her image, like this daughter up top, makes me so proud of how
										far I’ve come, and so thankful for where I come from.</p>

											Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn't really do it, they just saw something. It seemed obvious to them after a while. That's because they were able to connect experiences they've had and synthesize new things.

									<h3>Unordered List Style?</h3>
									<ul class="unordered-list-two">
										<li>The refractor telescope uses a convex lens to focus the light on the
											eyepiece.
										</li>

										<li>The reflector telescope has a concave lens which means it bends in. It uses
											mirrors
											to
											focus the image that you eventually see.</li>

										<li>Collimation is a term for how well tuned the telescope is to give you a good
											clear
											image of what you are looking at. You want your telescope to have good
											collimation
											so
											you are not getting a false image of the celestial body.</li>

										<li>Aperture is a fancy word for how big the lens of your telescope is. But it’s
											an
											important word because the aperture of the lens is the key to how powerful
											your
											telescope is. Magnification has nothing to do with it, its all in the
											aperture.
										</li>

										<li>Focuser is the housing that keeps the eyepiece of the telescope, or what you
											will
											look
											through, in place. The focuser has to be stable and in good repair for you
											to
											have
											an
											image you can rely on.</li>
										<li>Mount and Wedge. Both of these terms refer to the tripod your telescope sits
											on.
											The
											mount is the actual tripod and the wedge is the device that lets you attach
											the
											telescope to the mount.</li>
									</ul>
