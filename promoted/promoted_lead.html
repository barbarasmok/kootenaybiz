Wanda and I want to thank you personally for going the ‘extra mile’ which is what it took to find a buyer and get the money we needed out of the sale.”</p>

                                <h4>What is the market value of my home in the Cranbrook and Kimberley real estate market?</h4>							
                                <p>The market value is an opinion of what a property would sell for in a competitive market based on the features and benefits of that property. It factors in the overall real estate market in the area (such as supply and demand) and what similar properties have sold for in the same condition.</p>
                                <p>The market value of your home is not always the same as the city’s assessment on your home. That’s simply your home’s tax value.</p>                                   
                                <p>Arriving at the correct market value of your home is crucial to selling your home in a timely manner. That’s where you need the experience of a professional REALTOR®, someone who knows your real estate market like the back of her hand. </p>
                                <h4>What is a Comparative Market Analysis or a CMA? Is a CMA free?</h4>							
                                <p>A Comparative Market Analysis will tell you the value of your home. Sandy Smith offers free home evaluations (called CMAs) to determine your home’s market value. Using relevant home sales data, Sandy will look at active listings in your neighborhood to arrive at an estimate for an asking price for your home. </p>
                                <p>You can trust Sandy to provide you with professional advice to arrive at the right asking price. Call her today for your free home evaluation: 250-421-0835 </p>                                   
                                <h4>How will Sandy Smith advertise my home for sale in the Cranbrook real estate market?</h4>							
                                <p>The For Sale By Owner (FSBO) market share is about seven per cent and it keeps dropping year after year. The fact is there are pros and cons of selling your home any method, and each home sale has unique characteristics that may make one method or another more appropriate. </p>
